## Roadmap
Currently LSV's main focus is to make the linux customizing easier. Make the choice of colors easier. And variably configure the system.

Here's the current TODO list for LSV:
    - implement config.txt with lsv() and there connection.
        - Here the config.txt file will contain all the necessary variables used in a linux config while the lsv() function is used to embed those variables into the actual config files of other systems such as, Alacritty(Terminal), Waybar, Polybar, Many app launchers and window managers etc.
    - implement lsvc() for choosing colors.
        - The colors are prebuilt by default of many colorschemes such as gruvbox, gruvbox material, everforest, everblush, rosepine etc.
    - The planning shall extend, but for now this is it...
