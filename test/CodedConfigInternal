# Example of adding in-out paths to Coded.
# Here, the files provided will be able to use
# `coded()` & `codedC()` functions.
#
# The syntax for this method:
# 	[add] InOutFile <inPath> <outPath>
#
# If the input path is invalid the system will
# give an error.
#
# If the output path is wrong coded will recursively
# generate folders until the folder is valid.
